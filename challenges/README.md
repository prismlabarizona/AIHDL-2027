## Grading Schema

The AI-HDL competition employs a progressive grading scheme across four design phases (DP1–DP4). Each phase is graded independently according to its rubric, with only the strongest teams advancing to the next stage. At the end of the competition, cumulative performance determines the final ranking and winners.

##	**Phase-Based Evaluation**
**Design Phase 1** 
- 	**Weight**: 20% of total score
- 	**Cutoff**: Bottom 25–30% of teams advance based on functionality, verification success, and documentation completeness.
- 	**Advancement Criteria**: Teams must demonstrate a functional, synthesizable RTL with successful testbench results.

**Design Phase 2** 
- 	**Weight**: 25% of total score
- 	**Cutoff**: Another 25% of teams advance based on failure to achieve measurable improvements in power, performance, or area (PPA).
- 	**Advancement Criteria**: Teams must provide clear before/after metrics and maintain correctness after optimizations.

**Design Phase 3**
- 	**Weight:** 25% of total score
- 	**Cutoff:** The top 6–8 teams (depending on participation size) advance to the final phase.
- 	**Advancement Criteria:** Teams must implement and validate at least one major security feature, provide a structured vulnerability analysis, and maintain functional correctness.

**Design Phase 4** 
- 	**Weight:** 30% of total score
- 	**Final Evaluation:** The last stage evaluates complete implementation, sign-off quality, manufacturability, and final reporting.
- 	**Winners:** Final cumulative scores determine the Top 3 Teams, who are announced as the winners during the closing ceremony.

###	**Final Scoring Distribution**
| Phase | Focus Area | Weight |
|------|--------|--------|			 
| DP1 | Module Implementation & Verification |	20%	|
| DP2 |	PPA Optimization	| 25% |
| DP3	| Security Hardening	| 25%	|
| DP4 |	Physical Design & Tapeout	| 30% |

###	**Final Selection**
   •	The Top 3 teams are selected after DP4 based on their cumulative weighted score across all phases.
   •	Judges may award honorable mentions for exceptional innovation, documentation, or creative use of AI/LLMs in the design process, even if the team does not reach the Top 3.

###	**Bonus Opportunities:** Some unrequired achievements can earn bonus points (could tip the score above 100% in exceptional cases):
   •	Actually getting silicon back and demonstrating it working (if timeline permits – likely not within competition timeframe, but if competition later showcases it, that’s huge).
   •	Excellent open-source contribution: e.g., the team wrote a new feature for OpenROAD and used it.
   •	Going multi-core or multi-voltage design or other advanced ideas beyond scope.

###	**Grade Deductions**: On the flip side, certain failures can cost a lot of points:
   •	A design that doesn’t synthesize or doesn’t simulate correctly at final submission would fail the Functional criteria heavily, possibly disqualify.
   •	Not submitting a GDS or failing DRC/LVS means the design isn’t manufacturable, that’s a severe hit in Physical Implementation score.
   •	Not following the specified format (missing sections in documentation, missing citations, etc.) will reduce the Documentation score.
   •	Missing deadlines severely or requiring intervention to complete tasks might also reflect in scoring indirectly (as their results likely suffer).
